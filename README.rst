gce: GPU-Accelerated Condtional Entropy
=======================================

gce implements the conditional entropy (CE) search technique for periodic objects in electromagnetic surveys. This implementation is specifically for use with graphics processing units (GPU). The user inputs light curves as well as grid parameters used for each CE calculation. Basic statistics are calculated for these CE grids, which are then used to assign a significance to the minimum conditional entrop value.

Getting Started
---------------

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

Prerequisites
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

.. code-block::

   Give examples

Installing
^^^^^^^^^^

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

.. code-block::

   Give the example

And repeat

.. code-block::

   until finished

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

Running the tests
-----------------
